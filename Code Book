Experiment Description:

Experiment utilized 30 volunteers between the ages of 19-48 and included 6 unique activities. six activities.
Each participant was wearing a smartphone aroundt their waist with a embedded accelerometer and gyroscope.
The measurements included 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constand rate.

The data was randomly partitioned to have the test set including 30% of participants and the training set incuding 70% of the participants

Activity (while taken measurement):
1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING



Subject (number of the subject who participated in the activity):

Range: 1 - 30

Analysis:
Aggregated testing values with subject and activity data.  Aggregated training values with resptive subject and activity data.
Combined new testing set with new training set.
Created new data set only including measurements of mean or standard deviation.
Calculated the mean by subject and activity.
